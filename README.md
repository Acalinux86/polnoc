# A Simple Language that uses Reverse Polish Notation Implemented in C

The Language Supports basic arithmetic operation: Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction. It also supports the print function, that is able to print whatever value is on top of the Stack

## Usage
``` bash
$ make
$ ./build/polnoc -i ./test/1-test.txt # Pass input file
$ ./build/polnoc -s                   # Interactive Mode
```

### Acknowledgement
The language is an extension of a similar project I did: [RPN](https://github.com/acalinux86/rpn)
